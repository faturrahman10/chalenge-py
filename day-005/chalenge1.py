# Be a Computer
# Predict what will be printed from the code below:

# fruits = ["Apple", "Peach", "Pear"]
# for fruit in fruits:
#     print(fruit)
#     print(fruit + " pie")
# Indentation
# Indentation is very important in Python programming. Every time you see the : symbol used, you need to be careful about the indentation that comes afterwards.

# e.g. This code will behave very differently

# fruits = ["Apple", "Peach", "Pear"]
# for fruit in fruits:
#     print(fruit)
#     print("Hello")
# from this code:

# fruits = ["Apple", "Peach", "Pear"]
# for fruit in fruits:
#     print(fruit)
# print("Hello")

fruits = ["Apple", "Peach", "Pear"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
    print(fruit + " pie")

print(fruits)
